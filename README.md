# Kinematics-Calibration-of-a-Differential-drive


This is a study on the odometric reconstruction of a moving robot starting from four datasets.
As a consignment, data was cleared through a python script relying on the pandas package
Matlab anlisi was performed using classical equations of odometry to determine the geometric parameters of the robot. Using gentenetic algorithms to find the location of the camera.
