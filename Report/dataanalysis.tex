\subsection{Data Analysis}
To achieve the objective of calibration of the geometric parameters of the robot there were provided four datasets in each of which where collected the information from the camera and from the incremental encoder.
A first data operation was carried out by a python script to correct the registered angle sign as evaluated with a negative sign.
A second operation was to change the left encoder incremental measuring, since being mounted on reverse respect to the right its value must be taken with a negative sign.
In the file is observed the possibility of the presence of two successive rows with the same timestamp. 
This means that at the same time both the encoder ticks and the camera pose or covariance changed.
It may be noted that in one line has changed the camera information and the other the odometer ticks. 
Thus, at the same timestamp, in the second row is the information are modified.
So you chose to eliminate duplicate rows to preserve the last where both information camera pose or covariance and ticks has changed.
