\subsection{Data Analysis}
To achieve the objective of calibration of the geometric parameters of the robot there were provided four datasets where in each of which collected the information from the camera and from the incremental encoder.
A first data operation was carried out by a python script to correct the angle sign registered as evaluated with a negative sign.
A second operation and change the left encoder incremental measuring as being mounted on reverse respect to the right its value must be taken with a negative sign.
In the file is observed
the possibility of the presence of two successive rows with the same timestamp. This means that at the same time have been changed both the encoder ticks and the camera pose or covariance.
It may be noted that in one line has changed the camera information and the other the odometer ticks. \\Thus, at the same timestamp, in the second row is the information are modified.
So you chose to eliminate duplicate rows preserve the last where both information camera pose or covariance and ticks has changed.
