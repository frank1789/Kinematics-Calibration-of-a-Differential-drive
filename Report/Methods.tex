\subsection{Kinematic Model}
For the analysis of differential wheelchair drive parameters using a simplified model in the reference system own odometric placed in the center of the robot indicated by $RF1$. Consider that moves in a reference system fixed to the $RF0$ envoiroment. The robot is subject to pure rolling, then we neglect slippage between wheel and ground. The angular velocities, indicated respectively with omega, are applied respectively to the right and left wheels in such a way that the components of the fixed body and the speed of the robot are related to the angu- lar velocity of the wheels according to the equation functional \ref{eq:velocityrelation}. The other two sup- port wheels are considered passive. This schematization is observable in the fig. \ref{fig:model}.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:velocityrelation}
	\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
				v	\\									
				\omega 							
			 \end{array} 
	\right]  =\, C\,
	\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
 				\omega_\textsc{l} \\ 
				\omega_\textsc{r}
			 \end{array} 
	\right]
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[!h]

\end{figure}
\noindent Where the matrix $\textbf{C} \in \RealNumber^{2 x 2}$ is defined as (\ref{eq:Cmatrix}):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Cmatrix}
	\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
 				\frac{r_\textsc{r}}{2} &	\frac{r_\textsc{l}}{2} \\
				\frac{r_\textsc{l}}{b} &	-\frac{r_\textsc{l}}{b} 
			 \end{array} 
	\right]
\end{equation}
in which $r_\textsc{r}$ and $r_\textsc{l}$ are the radii of the right and left wheel, respectively.
The odometry of a vehicle is usually implemented by discrete-time integration, such as (\ref{eq:odometry}):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:odometry}
	\begin{cases}
		x_{k+1} = x_{k} + T \, v_{k} \, cos(\theta_{k} + T \,\omega_{k}/2)\\
		y_{k+1} = y_{k} + T \, v_{k} \, sin(\theta_{k} + T \, \omega_{k}/2)\\
		\theta_{k+1} = \theta_{k} + T \, \omega_{k}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}           
Notice that low sampling frequency and high vehicle velocities can be a significant source of odometric error.

\subsection{Calibration Techinque}
To estimate the parameters of the robot expressed in the equation \ref{eq:Cmatrix}, namely, the wheel radius values indicated with "$r_\textsc{r}$" and "$r_\textsc{l}$", and the axle track as indicated "$b$", using the method described in the report \cite{1512356}.
Experiments of odometry calibration require measurement of the absolute position and orientation of the mobile robot at suitable locations along the motion trajectories. For instance this calibration technique requires measurement of the starting and final robot configuration for each motion execution. The datasets supplied information related to: the camera position $x, y, \psi$ and increments of the encoder.
Each information is saved in columns:
\begin{itemize}
\item column 1: acquisistions time [ms];
\item columns 2--3--4: camera pose $x, y, \theta$ [cm, cm, rad];
\item column from 5 to 13: camera covariance ordered by rows [cm$2^2$] for pose, [rad$^2$] for angle and [cm*rad] for mixed terms;
\item colunm 14--15: odometric Encoder ticks Left and Right;
\end{itemize}
It has been chosen to perform the odometry calibration whereas in the same calculation all four datasets provided as suggested by the technique used. Then the equations \ref{eq:Phi4} and \ref{eq:XY4} are rewritten limited to the four paths to obtain:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Phi4}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\hat{c}_{2,1}\\
		\hat{c}_{2,2}
	\end{bmatrix} =	(\bar{\Phi}_{\theta}^{\textsc{t}} \, \bar{\Phi}_{\theta})^{-1} \, \bar{\Phi}_{\theta}^{\textsc{t}} \, 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\theta_{\textsc{n},1} - \theta_{\textsc{n},0}\\
		\theta_{\textsc{n},2} - \theta_{\textsc{n},0}\\
		\theta_{\textsc{n},3} - \theta_{\textsc{n},0}\\
		\theta_{\textsc{n},4} - \theta_{\textsc{n},0}
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:XY4}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\hat{c}_{1,1}\\
		\hat{c}_{1,2}
	\end{bmatrix} = (\bar{\Phi}_{xy}^{\textsc{t}} \, \bar{\Phi}_{xy})^{-1} \, \bar{\Phi}_{xy}^{\textsc{t}} \, 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		xy_{\textsc{n},1} - xy_{\textsc{n},0}\\
		xy_{\textsc{n},2} - xy_{\textsc{n},0}\\
		xy_{\textsc{n},3} - xy_{\textsc{n},0}\\
		xy_{\textsc{n},4} - xy_{\textsc{n},0}
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
 As a result of simulations shows the values of the matrix C:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Cresult}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		8.1873  &  6.5229\\
    	0.2823 &  -0.2807
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
It is noted that the parameters $c_ {1,1}$ and $c_ {1,2}$ relative to the spokes of the wheels are different from each other, this is due to the simplifications introduced by the kinematic model. On the other hands, the axle values, $c_ {2,1}$ and $c_ {2,2}$, without the negative sign, are much more similar because formerly esti- mated at c1,j therefore do not contain the error propagation. Subsequently, it calcu- lates the average between the values of the obtained rays and the standard deviation, these are shown in the table (\ref{tab:recapvalue}).
\begin{table}[!h]
\centering
	\begin{tabular}{lccc}
		\hline
								& Radius 	& Mean 	& standard  \\
								&	[mm]	& [mm]	& deviation [mm]\\
		\hline
		$r_\textsc{r}$	&	$130.457$		& $147.102	$		&	$\pm23.538$\\
		$r_\textsc{l}$	&	$163.746$		& $147.102	$		&	$\pm23.538$\\
		$b$					&	$522.43$\\
		\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{estimated value}
\label{tab:recapvalue}
\end{table}
Finally, we show in the figures \ref{fig:OdoRec}, it shows the calcu- lation for each path odometric with parameters previously estimated in comparison with the trajectory recorded by the camera.

\subsection{Optimization}

\end{figure*}
To achieve the goal of determining the offset of the camera mounted on the robot, recourse was made to a six-variable optimization. Following the parameters obtained previously, summarized in the table, were used as the maximum and minimum limits of the search space along with other parameters to determine: the distance from the robot center, the angle of rotation with respect to the reference system and the camera's orientation.
It is made of a matrix containing a large number of samples to cover a large number of combinations of these parameters generated randomly.
Were analyzed by a function that minimizes the error between ritch recorded by the camera and what rebuilt with odometry, thus they are obtained the values sought.
The optimization is performed for all the datasets thus returning four best combinations for each path, shows the values in a box plot in fig.  \ref{fig:boxplot}, where it is possible to observe:
\begin{itemize}
\item extreme values, represented by blacks hatches;
\item the median values, represented by the red segment;
\end{itemize}

After performing the optimization is unable to determine with greater accuracy the searched data and the results for all four datasets are visible in figures \ref{fig:OptiOdo}.
